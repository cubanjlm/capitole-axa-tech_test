## Initial steps
- Install docker for your platform of preference.
- Open a console and execute: `docker-compose up -d`
- Go to `http://localhost:8080` and on the left menu go to Databases.
- Create a new Database called `providers_db`. 
- Start `ProviderService.Api.Rest` project.
- Use the rest client of your preference. By default you can use [Client-calls.http](./ProviderService.Api.Rest/Client-calls.http) I defined in the api project.
